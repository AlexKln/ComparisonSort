# ComparisonSort
GUI for using some comparison sort algorithms and counting exact number of comparisons.  
Decent visualization of the lower bound for comparison based sorting algorithms(立(nlogn)),  
Although please note that 立(nlogn) or in general 立(f(n)) does not give you any idea about the expected value at a single point.  
That is because big-立 notation ignores constant factors, so the result for a particular value of n is completely undetermined.
