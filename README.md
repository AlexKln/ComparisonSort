# ComparisonSort
GUI for using comparison sort algorithms and counting exact number of comparisons.
Great visualization of the lower bound for comparison based sorting algorithms(Ω(nlogn)),
Although please note that this does not give you any idea about the expected value at a single point.
That is because big-Ω notation ignores constant factors, so the result for a particular value of n is completely undetermined.
